A DATABASE
- mongo db , mySQL ,postgress , sqllite
-ORM , ODM : used to interact with the data base
- store the given data

: backed can run on your device also
: data base is always on different component

: function runs in the backend 
    - mainly we are going to write funtions
    - asks db for stuff 
    - check if the stuff matchs with db

: going on a url causes a function to run
: send back the resoponse
: requests can come from anywhere


ESPRESS : routing 
MONGOOSE : used for Datbase

Data comming -

EXPRESS does all this LISTENING
EXPRESS sends the Response

GET  req send by the browser

NPM INIT
    - intialized the intial file sturture
    - creates the package.json

SCRIPTS
    - intializing scripts helps on server

- express is a web framework
- there are two types of imports that can be used - there function is basically the same


- in express we mainly deal with response and request 
- then there are different methods for each req and response

- we can intiate a listener to a port and continue listening contiously
- we can listen to specific req on a port

.listen is used in general to start a server
.get is used to listen to  a specific request : on a specific port 


TAKING THIS APP TO PRODUCTION

we have to hide some stuff that is very senstive
- data base user name and password
